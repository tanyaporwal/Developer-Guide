### Tick Size

Tick size refers to the minimum allowable price movement for a particular financial instrument in a trading market. It serves as the smallest increment by which the price of equity, future, or other exchange-traded asset can change. In essence, tick size dictates the granularity of price changes that are permitted during trading sessions.

For instance, let's consider the NSE Nifty, a prominent stock market index in India. The tick size for Nifty futures contracts is typically 0.05. This means that the price of the Nifty futures contract can only change in increments of 0.05 points. So, if the Nifty is trading at 11500, the next permissible price levels would be 11500.05, 11500.10, 11500.15, and so forth.

If for any instrument the Tick Size is 00001. A price change, then, from 1.2345 to 1.2346 would represent one tick. Ticks do not have to be measured in factors of 10. For example, a market might measure price movements in minimum increments of 0.25. For that market, a price change from 450.00 to 451.00 is four ticks or one point.
Tick sizes are integral to maintaining order and consistency within financial markets. They are defined by regulatory bodies or exchange operators and are outlined in the contract specifications for each trading instrument. In futures markets, tick sizes are often fixed, whereas in stock markets, they may vary based on the price level of the asset.
