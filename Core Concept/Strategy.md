## Strategy
Strategy is the heart of BlitzTrader and it is algorithmic trading programs that define a set of instructions or rules for entering and exiting trades, with the goal of identifying alpha opportunities, managing market impact, or optimizing risk. Developers implement these entry and exit rules based on their market knowledge and hypotheses, and the strategy automatically executes trades in real-time.

The BlitzTrader Strategy development API offers an environment for building rule-based strategies, enabling monitoring of real-time prices, order submission, cancellation or modification based on market data events, receiving order and fill updates, and accessing positions and real-time trade statistics.

The Strategy development framework effectively decouples the core strategy business logic from the underlying complex software managing straight-through processing, providing a cleaner separation for developers to focus solely on their core trading and research strengths.

Quant developers leverages familiar tools like Visual Studio.NET IDE and the Microsoft.NET programming language. This allows developers to utilize existing skills and benefit from a comprehensive development environment with code IntelliSense and debugging capabilities. You can set breakpoints, step through code, and monitor values to refine your strategies during market simulation.
