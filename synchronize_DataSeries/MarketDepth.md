### Market Depth
Market depth, a component of Level-II data, offers insights into the supply and demand dynamics of a stock across different price levels. It serves as a crucial indicator of market sentiment, providing traders with a comprehensive view of the market's liquidity and potential price movements. Essentially, market depth displays the cumulative volume of orders at each price level, revealing the depth of the market's liquidity profile. This information is dynamic, continuously updating to reflect new orders entering the market and existing orders being executed or withdrawn. In essence, market depth provides traders with a comprehensive overview of current market activity, empowering them to make informed decisions based on the prevailing supply and demand dynamics.
