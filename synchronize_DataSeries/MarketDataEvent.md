### Market Data Event

BlitzTrader's API empowers your strategy by providing real-time market data, encompassing both Level-I and Level-II data. Level-I data includes best bid and offer quotes for tradable securities, offering a snapshot of current market prices. On the other hand, Level-II data delves deeper, revealing the highest bid prices, lowest ask prices, and corresponding sizes from various market participants for a specific security. This granular Level-II data is invaluable to traders as it sheds light on the buying and selling pressure behind individual securities.

Before delving into the utilization of Blitz API for handling market data events and accessing price information, it's essential to grasp some fundamental market-related price terminologies.
